This repository cantains the official software implementation of **SPLATONIC**, a sparse and efficient realtime [3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) SLAM algorithm-hardware co-design with a novel rendering pipeline for resource-constrained device. Specifically, SPLATONIC proposes an adaptive pixel sampling algorithm with up to **256x computaion reduction** as well as comparable accuracy, and address the underutilization in original training process with pixel-based rendering pipeline. SPLATONIC could achieve **14.6x speedup** on NVIDIA AGX Orin mobile SoC on average.

This implementation is based on [SplaTAM](https://github.com/spla-tam/SplaTAM), we will release implementations based on other algorithms in the future.

## Installation

To install requirements:
```shell
conda create -n splatonic python=3.10
conda activate splatonic
# Example for CUDA 12.8:
pip3 install torch==2.7.1 torchvision==0.22.1 torchaudio==2.7.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note:** [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) installation varies by system. Please ensure you install the appropriate version for your hardware.

## Data Preparation

Download the datasets according to instruction from [SplaTAM](https://github.com/spla-tam/SplaTAM?tab=readme-ov-file#downloads). The datasets will be stored into `./data` by default.

```bash
# Replica
bash bash_scripts/download_replica.sh

# TUM-RGBD
bash bash_scripts/download_tum.sh
```

## Usage

### Run

Taking Replica as an example, to run SplaTAM with SPLATONIC, please run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/splatam_sparse.py configs/replica/splatam.py
```

To run SplaTAM without SPLATONIC, please run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/splatam.py configs/replica/splatam.py
```

Similar to [SplaTAM](https://github.com/spla-tam/SplaTAM?tab=readme-ov-file#replica-1), you can modify the `configs/replica/splatam.py file` or use `configs/replica/replica.bash`. You can replace 'replica' with 'tum' to evaluate TUM-RGBD dataset.

### Benchmarking

We evaluate performance by measuring the elapse that pipeline completely execute a forward and backward pass, reported in the script code as `Iteration time`. We also provide `Frame Time` that reports elapse the application execute a complete frame tracking/mapping.
